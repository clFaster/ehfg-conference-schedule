    "description": "In an era marked by geopolitical tensions, climate change, natural disasters, growing social inequalities, and the rise of misinformation, Europe faces a new kind of uncertainty. We need to understand how to navigate this complex landscape and continue to advance public health, building strong and resilient health systems for health security. The COVID-19 pandemic showed us that underinvesting in preparedness and prevention costs lives, weakens economies, and erodes trust in institutions. The question is no longer if we should invest in health security, but how boldly we are willing to act.Health security is not a luxury, it is a cornerstone of Europe’s future. From tackling vector-borne diseases and vaccine-preventable diseases to fighting antimicrobial resistance, we must be ready for both known and unknown threats. Access to medical countermeasures is essential, but true resilience begins long before a crisis: with political commitment, robust health systems, and proactive strategies.This session will explore health security from multiple perspectives, focusing on necessary public health interventions and actions, the economic impact of inaction, policy decisions, and the power of cross-sectoral collaboration. How can we keep prevention and preparedness high on the agenda, even as Member States face competing priorities? How can we align Member States’ strategies to build a truly European approach to health security? And how do we clearly demonstrate the return on investment?Join us to discuss how today’s decisions will shape tomorrow’s health security. Because resilient societies are not built in the heat of crisis, they are built in advance.",

It is also deeply connected with socio-economic and gender inequality. Following the robust response to the COVID-19 pandemic and Europe's Beating Cancer Plan, this session will discuss the case for an ambitious strategic plan to improve cardiovascular health across the region. Such a plan would address a pressing health need, help deliver on broader resilience, security and competitiveness agendas, and demonstrate that the EU protects all citizens regardless of geography, gender, or background through concrete actions rooted in fairness, prevention, and the public good.The panel brings together patients, healthcare professionals, and policy experts to examine how evidence-based policy grounded in equity and solidarity principles can promote cardiovascular health and strengthen social bonds that unite European societies.",

The COVID-19 pandemic exposed the vulnerabilities of these systems to misinformation and disinformation, which undermined public health efforts and social cohesion. Infodemiology, a developing public health field, is increasingly being integrated into routine public health operations to mitigate misinformation and foster healthier health information ecosystems. Regional healthcare bodies, national ministries, and local departments are at various stages of advancing their health communications strategies to increase programme effectiveness. External factors such as rapid adoption of AI and political and social polarisation create both barriers and opportunities. This requires coordination, capacity building, and the cultivation of systems, institutions, and norms that enable reliable information and trusted communication to flourish.

Meanwhile, life sciences innovations like gene-based therapies, genomic testing, and medical robotics promise better outcomes but remain unevenly accessible across Member States, undermining solidarity. The traditional rhetoric about Member States' competences in healthcare has hindered a more nuanced debate about the EU’s role in funding health innovation in Europe. Despite this, mechanisms such as research & development incentives and funding frameworks, including the Multiannual Financial Framework and the Italian Innovation Fund, could bridge access gaps. A panel of experts will explore balancing access, innovation, and affordability within the European Union’s political context and the European Policy Centre’s recommendations. ",

    "description": "Session format: FishbowlEnd-of-life care embodies the social contract at its most fundamental level, as meeting people’s needs during this vulnerable life stage rests primarily with government services. Yet, across Europe, access to end-of-life services in full respect of the wishes and rights of patients remains uneven. This is partly because some of these services, like assisted dying, are - where legal - shaped by socioeconomic disparities, policy gaps, and polarised views among health professionals. As solidarity in health is increasingly challenged across Europe, how can we ensure that end-of-life care remains a shared governmental and societal responsibility, that is adequately resourced, and not over-medicalised despite strained health budgets and competing political priorities? This question is relevant across diseases, and particularly so in cancer, where innovative approaches to patient support have been emerging. The OBS-PACE project collects case studies on innovations in cancer, along Europe’s Beating Cancer Plan, and provides valuable insights into how innovations can strengthen end-of-life and supportive care.The session presents the key issues of debate in end-of-life and supportive care in the context of the broader social contract. It aims to underline the need for strengthened partnerships to foster fair and inclusive end-of-life care, with people’s emotional and spiritual needs, equally relevant as their medical ones, at the centre. This session will underline the responsibility of governments within the social contract to provide clarity in policies that uphold dignity and quality of life during the end-of-life period. ",

This session will facilitate a discussion around the challenges of tackling AMR in Europe, zooming in on current inequalities and gaps, and how these can be addressed.The discussion will look at the different drivers of inequalities in AMR across Europe, including between countries as well as among women and men. It will explore best practices, different complementary approaches beyond antibiotics in the fight against AMR, and the role of European initiatives like the EU’s Preparedness Strategy and the Joint Action on AMR and Healthcare-Associated Infections. With decreased trust in institutions since the COVID-19 pandemic, governments cannot fail in curbing AMR as they work to restore public confidence.",

    "description": "Europe’s healthcare landscape is undergoing a pivotal transformation. With the implementation of the European Health Data Space (EHDS) and the Health Technology Assessment Regulation (HTAR), a new era has emerged - one rooted in leveraging data and innovation to build efficient, evidence-based, and patient-centered health systems. At the heart of this transformation lies a critical, yet often understated enabler, the digital collection and standardised measurement of patient outcomes in routine care.This session will explore the unique power of digitally captured patient outcomes to elevate Europe as a global leader in life sciences. Empowered patients, equipped to monitor and report their health outcomes digitally, can fundamentally reshape communication between patients and clinicians ensuring that healthcare delivery aligns with real needs. Yet, the true power of these outcomes is amplified when they are digitally captured, standardised, and aggregated into Real-World Evidence (RWE) libraries that unlock unparalleled value for scientific research.",

Furthermore, innovation cycles have changed – not least because of digital automation and AI, as well as advances in the field of personalised medicine - and regulators are challenged to keep pace with these developments.With this in mind, this session will focus on how the European Medicines Agency, together with the European Regulatory Network, support innovation in the EU across the lifecycle of a medicine, with specific reference to innovative manufacturing. The use of novel manufacturing technologies and analytical techniques for the design, manufacture, and quality control of medicines can help not only improve the quality of medicines, but also improve the supply of existing ones and facilitate the adoption of more sustainable practices with a reduced carbon footprint. New technologies can also bring manufacturing closer to patients, right to the point of care.The session will highlight international collaboration and case studies that have accelerated the manufacturing of innovative medicines and explore how the revision to the EU pharmaceutical legislation will further enhance support for innovation.

Sam Altman, CEO of Open AI, suggested AI could force a complete reconfiguration of society. Traditional solidarity systems, funded by labour-related taxes, may be weakened as labour markets are disrupted. Globalisation and automation may create tax gaps, raising questions about future revenue sources for social protection. Ethical concerns include misinformation, elitism, and digital inequality.

    "description": "Sexual and reproductive health and rights (SRHR) is an issue that affects everyone worldwide. Every human being has the right to make free, informed and self-determined decisions about their own body, sexuality and reproduction – without discrimination, coercion or violence. This affects every area of life and society as a whole. In order to ensure that people can shape their sexual and reproductive health in a self-determined way, sufficient and low-threshold access to information, services and medical care is needed. All institutions, local and international organisations and political leaders are called upon to do this.For this reason, the Vienna Institute for International Dialogue and Cooperation (VIDC), THE RAIN WORKERS - Network for sexual and reproductive health, the Austrian Public Health Association and Women in Global Health - Austrian Chapter aim to establish SRHR as a key function for social, health and economic development.In a panel discussion with audience participation and networking activities, the complexity of the topic will be examined from different perspectives. Against the backdrop of global developments in the field of sexual and reproductive health and the impact of drastic cuts in international development funding, experts from the fields of health, gender, development cooperation and humanitarian aid will work out the interfaces and relevance of SRHR for global cooperation and Austria. Based on a gender-reflective interpretation of international law, the focus will be on gynaecological counselling and care in Austria as well as on the care of people in East Africa and in war and crisis zones. Gender and diversity aspects in medicine, as well as the negative health effects of discrimination, underline the importance of social determinants of health and reflect historically evolved patriarchal power structures. This will also be reflected in another angle to the discussion: access to clean water and the possibility of being able to take care of menstrual hygiene safely and undisturbed.Feminist empowerment by female leaders in the health care system, through economic independence and through a self-determined, informed approach to one's own body will run like a red thread through the event. The diversity of perspectives on the podium is represented by voices from the Global North and South as well as by different professional backgrounds. Further voices and experiences from the audience should ensure that the individual threads will be woven together to create a canvas of the big picture which represents SRHR.The aim of the event is to raise awareness and insight: SRHR concerns us all and needs more attention worldwide! Register here before 15 October.Panelists Sabine Ludwig, Professor of Diversity in Medicine at the Medical University of Innsbruck Susanne Hölbfer, Senior Physician in the gynecology department and head of the victim protection group at the Ottakring Clinic Mercy Muthoni Kamau, Executive Director of Mathari Children Fund Panairobi Stephanie Johanssen, Policy Advisor for sexual and reproductive health and rights at Doctors Without Borders Germany Henry Ouma, Water, Sanitation and Hygiene (WASH) Expert Video message from UNFPA Willibald Zeck, Austrian gynecologist and Associate Professor of gynecology and obstetrics.
