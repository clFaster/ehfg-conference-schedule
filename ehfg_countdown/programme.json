Making health systems fit to meet these demands requires rethinking outdated decision-making models and transitioning towards innovative governance and financing approaches. Importantly, lessons learned during the COVID-19 pandemic must be seized to close existing care gaps and enhance the resilience of health systems.Turning forward-looking ideas into actions is a challenging endeavour for governments, which requires commitment, ownership and a novel conceptualisation of innovation and governance. At EU level, countries can access various forms of support to facilitate the implementation of innovative health system solutions.This session will examine such instruments more closely by sharing experiences from different national contexts with a focus on implementing primary healthcare solutions. Through testimonials, real-life case examples and interactive discussions, the session will reflect on the European setting and examine what it takes to accomplish innovation in health systems today.","speakers": []},{"eventname": "Reflection Roundtable &amp; other activities","subtitle": "Visit the digital Networking Lounges in the EHFG conference platform","eventid": "1930","eventcategory": "Networking Break","eventshortid": "N1","date": "2021-09-27","start": "11:00","end": "11:00","location": "Networking Lounges","lat": "","lng": "","description": "After each session, head to the Reflection Roundtable to discuss session outcomes with your fellow participants (moderated by Young Forum Gastein scholars during most session breaks), visit the Gastein Social Lounge to decompress and chat about whatever you like - or take an active break away from your screen!","speakers": []},{"eventname": "Oslo Medicines Initiative","subtitle": "A new vision for collaboration between the public and private sectors","eventid": "1863","eventcategory": "Session","eventshortid": "S2","date": "2021-09-27","start": "12:30","end": "12:30","location": "Room 1","lat": "","lng": "","headline": "Organised by WHO Regional Office for Europe, the Norwegian Ministry of Health and Care Services, and the Norwegian Medicines Agency","description": "Launched at the EHFG last year, the Oslo Medicines Initiative (OMI) aims to build a collaborative platform where stakeholders can come together to identify actions to improve patient-access to effective high cost novel medicines across the European Region.Continuing dialogue with all stakeholders is paramount to find common ground and agree to transparent, sustainable solutions that are of mutual benefit to Member-States and non-State actors, including health systems, payers, patients, and industry).

Yet instead, the problems of the multilateral system have been revealed centre stage.Rising nationalism has undermined global cooperation, there has been open hostility towards multilateral institutions and a growing tendency to pursue unilateral approaches especially when it comes to COVID-19 vaccines - ignoring the oft-repeated mantra that no one is safe until everyone is safe. Following years of policies that successively eroded multilateral institutions, the need for improved collaboration and knowledge sharing to ensure a resilient future has become crystal clear. Countries need to strengthen the collaborative fora and instruments that are crucial for effective global solidarity.This plenary will ask how we can better cooperate in the face of future crises. What alliances and strategies are crucial to more effectively engage with diverse rival powers? Can we invent a new and more inclusive kind of multilateralism?

While the pandemic signalled a boom in areas like telemedicine and AI, our European frameworks were not conducive to a context which demanded ‘fast innovation’, and many quick fixes needed to be introduced to allow healthcare systems to provide the solutions to patients that were so greatly needed.From a lack of digitalisation and electronic records in many health systems, as well as legislative gaps and fragmentation among Member States in crisis management, to the inflexibilities of regulatory and reimbursement frameworks, to complexities around patient consent and the use of specific data: the stark reality is that the context did not help us to react quickly.Moving on from the pandemic, it is clear that that things must change. Networks like EIT Health, driving quick action by connecting minds and organisations in business, research and education, play a vital role for Europe’s recovery and response to future crises, as well as for dealing with the everyday realities of growing demand and challenges around healthcare in areas like non-communicable disease.In this session, we will take a look at the trends and innovations that have emerged from the EIT Health community during the pandemic, and explore the gap between the potential of digital health solutions - extending far beyond the pandemic - and the current reality.

Join us in this session to discuss how the EU can seize the opportunity to rise like a phoenix and address issues that prevent rare disease patients from accessing the care they need.","speakers": [ {"speaker": "Hernández García, César","speakerid": "2020","organisation": "Spanish Medicines Agency"},{"speaker": "Buxo, Manuela","speakerid": "1976","organisation": "Sanofi Genzyne", "image": "https://www.ehfg.org/fileadmin/_processed_/1/d/csm_Buxo_Manuela_fadff5d964.jpg"},{"speaker": "Gabaldo, Michela","speakerid": "1977","organisation": "Fondazione Telethon", "image": "https://www.ehfg.org/fileadmin/_processed_/c/c/csm_Gabaldo_Michela_738d20c3bf.jpg"},{"speaker": "Le Cam, Yann","speakerid": "1978","organisation": "EURORDIS", "image": "https://www.ehfg.org/fileadmin/_processed_/d/0/csm_Le_Cam_Yann_7d1a308781.jpg"},{"speaker": "Natz, Alexander","speakerid": "1425","organisation": "EUCOPE", "image": "https://www.ehfg.org/fileadmin/_processed_/7/f/csm_NATZ_Alexander_5ced7e98a6.jpg"},{"speaker": "Jervelund, Christian","speakerid": "1975","organisation": "Copenhagen Economics", "image": "https://www.ehfg.org/fileadmin/_processed_/a/4/csm_Jervelund_Christian_3b47b88f38.jpg"}]},{"eventname": "Reflection Roundtable &amp; other activities","eventid": "1938","eventcategory": "Networking Break","eventshortid": "N9","date": "2021-09-29","start": "11:00","end": "11:00","location": "Networking Lounges","lat": "","lng": "","headline": "Visit the digital Networking Lounges in the EHFG conference platform","description": "After each session, head to the Reflection Roundtable to discuss session outcomes with your fellow participants (moderated by Young Forum Gastein scholars during most session breaks), visit the Gastein Social Lounge to decompress and chat about whatever you like - or take an active break away from your screen!","speakers": []},{"eventname": "The future of health threats preparedness","eventid": "1875","eventcategory": "Session","eventshortid": "S11","date": "2021-09-29","start": "12:30","end": "12:30","location": "Room 1","lat": "","lng": "","headline": "Organised by European Commission Directorate-General for Health and Food Safety","description": "Session details coming soon!","speakers": []},{"eventname": "Young Forum Gastein Networking Break","eventid": "1939","eventcategory": "Networking Break","eventshortid": "N10","date": "2021-09-29","start": "13:00","end": "13:00","location": "Networking Lounges","lat": "","lng": "","headline": "Organised by Young Forum Gastein","description": "Are you a young professional in public health - or interested in what the next generation of leaders in health has to say - and want to learn more about the Young Forum Gastein network?

Join us to brainstorm and discuss ideas that question existing business models, explore new approaches to financing rare disease treatment, and to create a flagship for the future.","speakers": [ {"speaker": "Athanasiou, Dimitrios","speakerid": "2019","organisation": "European Patient Forum"},{"speaker": "Krumpl, Günther","speakerid": "1999","organisation": "AOP Orphan", "image": "https://www.ehfg.org/fileadmin/_processed_/c/f/csm_Krumpl_Gunther_5cec3cb03e.jpg"},{"speaker": "Papageorgiou, Labrini","speakerid": "1998","organisation": "Roche", "image": "https://www.ehfg.org/fileadmin/_processed_/2/b/csm_Papageorgiou_Labrini_0a8662f963.jpg"},{"speaker": "Bergström, Richard","speakerid": "520","organisation": "Government Offices of Sweden", "image": "https://www.ehfg.org/fileadmin/_processed_/5/d/csm_04_board_BergstroemRichard%402x_3856a6cbf5.jpg"}]},{"eventname": "Reflection Roundtable &amp; other activities","subtitle": "Visit the digital Networking Lounges in the EHFG conference platform","eventid": "1947","eventcategory": "Networking Break","eventshortid": "N17","date": "2021-10-01","start": "13:00","end": "13:00","location": "Networking Lounges","lat": "","lng": "","description": "After each session, head to the Reflection Roundtable to discuss session outcomes with your fellow participants (moderated by Young Forum Gastein scholars during most session breaks), visit the Gastein Social Lounge to decompress and chat about whatever you like - or take an active break away from your screen!","speakers": []},{"eventname": "A new social contract for a resilient recovery","eventid": "1866","eventcategory": "Plenary","eventshortid": "P3","date": "2021-10-01","start": "14:30","end": "14:30","location": "Main Stage","lat": "","lng": "","headline": "Organised by the European Health Forum Gastein","description": "The complex nature of the challenges we are currently facing could be described as a “poly-pandemic” - comprising multi-faceted crises of an ecological, economic, democratic and inegalitarian nature. This poses great challenges to humanity, but we shouldn´t forget it also offers opportunities: not least “to build forward better”.In this vein the idea of a new social contract (an agreement of everyone with everyone to protect and further the common good) has once again come to the fore. This could lay the foundation for the systemic reforms and responses that we need to build a more resilient future - inclusive, sustainable and solidaric policies that protect both vulnerable populations and ecosystems. Such policies are in the self-interest of everyone and are strategic investments for a healthy future. In a European context, this plenary will explore what such policies could look like and what ideas and innovations can help our phoenix rise again.","speakers": [ {"speaker": "Monti, Mario","speakerid": "1951","organisation": "Pan-European Commission on Health and Sustainable Development", "image": "https://www.ehfg.org/fileadmin/_processed_/5/4/csm_MONTI_mario_f6c7d80422.jpg"},{"speaker": "Poklular, Janez","speakerid": "1955","organisation": "Republic of Slovenia", "image": "https://www.ehfg.org/fileadmin/_processed_/a/c/csm_POKLUKAR_janez_33882e01d8.jpg"},{"speaker": "Burrow, Sharan","speakerid": "2001","organisation": "International Trade Union Confederation", "image": "https://www.ehfg.org/fileadmin/_processed_/2/8/csm_Burrow_Sharan_1306e39459.jpg"},{"speaker": "McKee, Martin","speakerid": "401","organisation": "London School of Hygiene &amp; Tropical Medicine", "image": "https://www.ehfg.org/fileadmin/_processed_/6/0/csm_MCKEE_Martin_Kopie_25a720605b.jpg"}]},{"eventname": "Reflection Roundtable &amp; other activities","subtitle": "Visit the digital Networking Lounges in the EHFG conference platform","eventid": "1948","eventcategory": "Networking Break","eventshortid": "N18","date": "2021-10-01","start": "15:00","end": "15:00","location": "Networking Lounges","lat": "","lng": "","description": "After each session, head to the Reflection Roundtable to discuss session outcomes with your fellow participants (moderated by Young Forum Gastein scholars during most session breaks), visit the Gastein Social Lounge to decompress and chat about whatever you like - or take an active break away from your screen!r completing your registration!","speakers": []},{"eventname": "A healthier future for all","subtitle": "Creating fairer, healthier &amp; more resilient post-pandemic societies","eventid": "1886","eventcategory": "Session","eventshortid": "S22","date": "2021-10-01","start": "16:30","end": "16:30","location": "Room 1","lat": "","lng": "","headline": "Organised by The Health Foundation","description": "A healthy population is one of any nation's most important assets, supporting positive social and economic outcomes for individuals and society. The pandemic and response to it have exposed pre-existing inequalities in our society. Addressing these inequalities, and ensuring a pandemic recovery that improves both health and the economy, will require cross-government action.In this session, we will present findings from The Health Foundation’s COVID-19 impact inquiry into the pandemic’s implications for the UK’s health and health inequalities, and reflect on the findings with a panel of international and intersectoral stakeholders, who will discuss what must be done to measure and combat health inequity all across Europe. We will look at how people’s circumstances going into the pandemic – their health, job, housing, education – shaped their experience of the crisis, and outline opportunities to better support those who have been most affected.Join us to discuss the policy responses that are needed across governments to create fairer, healthier and more resilient societies, including priority policy options for improving health, tackling inequalities, and ways of working across governments.","speakers": []},{"eventname": "Reflection Roundtable &amp; other activities","subtitle": "Visit the digital Networking Lounges in the EHFG conference platform","eventid": "1949","eventcategory": "Networking Break","eventshortid": "N19","date": "2021-10-01","start": "17:00","end": "17:00","location": "Networking Lounges","lat": "","lng": "","description": "After each session, head to the Reflection Roundtable to discuss session outcomes with your fellow participants (moderated by Young Forum Gastein scholars during most session breaks), visit the Gastein Social Lounge to decompress and chat about whatever you like - or take an active break away from your screen!","speakers": []},{"eventname": "The Economy of Well-being revolution","subtitle": "A new paradigm for future fit funding","eventid": "1950","eventcategory": "Session","eventshortid": "S23","date": "2021-10-01","start": "18:00","end": "18:00","location": "Room 1","lat": "","lng": "","headline": "Organised by EuroHealthNet and Nordic Health 2030 Movement","description": "It is widely recognised that prevention is a more economical and effective approach than cure, and yet, health promotion and preventative care has long been a secondary thought in the science of wellbeing.
