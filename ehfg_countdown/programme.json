    "description": "European health systems are facing unprecedented challenges, from ageing populations to budgetary constraints and global pandemics. Making health systems fit to meet these demands requires rethinking outdated decision-making models and transitioning towards innovative governance and financing approaches. Importantly, lessons learned during the COVID-19 pandemic must be seized to close existing care gaps and enhance the resilience of health systems.Turning forward-looking ideas into actions is a challenging endeavour for governments, which requires commitment, ownership and a novel conceptualisation of innovation and governance. At EU level, countries can access various forms of support to facilitate the implementation of innovative health system solutions.This session will examine such instruments more closely by sharing experiences from different national contexts with a focus on implementing primary healthcare solutions. Through testimonials, real-life case examples and interactive discussions, the session will reflect on the European setting and examine what it takes to accomplish innovation in health systems today.",

The initiative aims to reshape the political discourse, implement pragmatic step-by-step solutions, and create partnerships to build a movement for systemic change.Supported by consultations, background documents and webinars, OMI will culminate in a high-level meeting in Oslo on 13-14 June 2022. OMI is a unique opportunity for stakeholders to discuss some of the major challenges and collectively agree on new opportunities for collaboration. Join us in this session to envision a sustainable future for better access to medicines across Europe and beyond!",

    "description": "Two years ago one would have been forgiven for imagining that the sudden onset of a global pandemic - leaving no person or country unaffected - could be the moment that the world pulls together to fight a common challenge. Yet instead, the problems of the multilateral system have been revealed centre stage.Rising nationalism has undermined global cooperation, there has been open hostility towards multilateral institutions and a growing tendency to pursue unilateral approaches especially when it comes to COVID-19 vaccines - ignoring the oft-repeated mantra that no one is safe until everyone is safe. Following years of policies that successively eroded multilateral institutions, the need for improved collaboration and knowledge sharing to ensure a resilient future has become crystal clear. Countries need to strengthen the collaborative fora and instruments that are crucial for effective global solidarity.This plenary will ask how we can better cooperate in the face of future crises. What alliances and strategies are crucial to more effectively engage with diverse rival powers? Can we invent a new and more inclusive kind of multilateralism? To what extent is the EU a credible partner for countries in the Global South right now? Above all, what role can Europe play in a “refresh” of multilateralism?",

How would healthcare systems and cancer care 3.0 look?Europe’s Beating Cancer Plan: if implemented, cancer care could rise like a Phoenix post-COVID-19 to restore what we missed, to build back better and turn a new page for cancer care.

    "description": "Communities are increasingly recognised as key partners for outbreak preparedness and response. ‘Communities’ include not only at-risk groups, but also other stakeholders who are linked to these affected populations and who may be able to support the preparedness and response process. Such actors may already exist in the civic or public realm or they may emerge during emergency events in the form of new coalitions.We have seen during the COVID-19 pandemic that socially vulnerable populations may be disproportionally affected by a public health crisis, and they also are often under-represented in active stakeholder groups responding to the crisis. The principles of community engagement therefore need to be kept at the core, including and in particular for socially vulnerable populations. This requires the involvement of community-based partners in the exchange of risk information, and the development of a trusting foundation for shared decision-making that, in addition to health concerns, necessarily also addresses a range of social, economic, political, and environmental issues.The ultimate aim of community engagement activities is to facilitate the development of an informed community that – in collaboration with the health and relevant non-health sectors – is empowered to ensure the security and protection of all its members.Join us in this session to share your experience from the COVID-19 pandemic and envision how civil society and national authorities can work together with communities to address future health emergencies equitably and effectively.",

    "description": "The COVID-19 crisis has acted as an accelerant of innovation in many areas, especially when it comes to the adoption of healthcare solutions such as digital platforms for care management. While the pandemic signaled a boom in areas such as telemedicine and AI, what remains clear is that our European frameworks were not wholly conducive to a context which demanded ‘fast innovation’, and many quick fixes needed to be introduced at speed to allow healthcare systems to provide solutions to patients that were so greatly needed.From a lack of digitalisation and electronic records in many health systems, as well as legislative gaps and fragmentation among Member States in crisis management, to the inflexibilities of regulatory and reimbursement frameworks, to complexities around patient consent and the use of specific data, the stark reality is that the circumstances did not help us to react quickly.Moving on from the pandemic, things must change. Innovation ecosystems like EIT Health, driving quick action connecting minds and organisations in business, research and education, as well as healthcare delivery, play a vital role for Europe’s recovery and response to current and future crises as well as dealing with the everyday realities of growing demand around healthcare due to challenges such as non-communicable diseases.This session will build around three concrete examples of innovation and entrepreneurship as supported by EIT Health during the pandemic, to reflect on the trends driving health care transformation and innovation and explore – from the perspective of innovators, policymakers, patients, health care professionals and providers - how a whole of society, ecosystem approach may contribute to more a more resilient future.",

With an ageing population and vast disparities in morbidity and mortality within and across countries in Europe, it is already evident that the burden of CVD may be on a downward turn. Already some countries are seeing increases in incidence, prevalence and mortality compared to previous years. The impact of comorbidities like CVD and other cardiometabolic diseases on COVID-19 outcomes are also emerging as a key health determinant. Now is the time to act to ensure health systems return to a focus on CVD as a critical health issue and demonstrate decisive action to improve the many modifiable risks that exist. Now is the time to mobilize and connect CVD stakeholders in creating an effective platform for Europe to raise CVD higher on health policy agendas.Join us in this interactive session to explore how we can build on the joint statement calling on the EU to develop a comprehensive plan on CVD, conceptualize new CVD partnership models, address the future continuity of care for patients, mitigate the impact of the secondary health crisis, and challenge existing inequalities as we seek to set out a new policy vision for CVD.",

The EU Orphan Medicinal Product (OMP) Regulation has proven a tremendous success for patients, promoting research and innovation in the rare disease space since its adoption. Today, there are about 200 approved treatments for rare diseases, giving hope to more than 20 million people.At the same time, the pandemic has highlighted fundamental challenges faced by rare disease patients, such as the need for disease screening, access to care, and stress. To continue supporting patients and provide treatment during the crisis, important lessons have been learnt regarding access to care and digitalisation.As the OMP Regulation undergoes review in 2021, another pivotal legislative moment for rare diseases is on the horizon, and with it an opportunity to tackle remaining gaps in rare disease research, investment and care. Join us in this session to discuss how the EU can seize the opportunity to rise like a phoenix and address issues that prevent rare disease patients from accessing the care they need.",

The European Health Union will better protect the health of the citizens, equip the EU and its Member states to better prevent and address future pandemics and improve the resilience of Europe’s health systems. A strong European Health Union will allow all EU countries to prepare and respond together to health crises, making medical supplies available, affordable and innovative and working together to improve prevention, treatment and aftercare.The new framework will also extend the role of EU agencies in the coordination of preparedness and response measures and will include a European Health Emergency Preparedness and Response Authority (HERA). Increased coordination, declaration of an EU emergency situation, strengthened and integrated surveillance system, reporting on health systems indicators and monitoring and mitigating the risk of shortages of critical medicines and medical devices are the main challenges and the axes of a new preparedness framework.

It has become clear that to recover and stand a chance against future crises it is not enough to firefight, uniting only around our most immediate threats.A new approach to health in Europe with new forms of solidarity needs to emerge from the crisis. A European Health Union offers the framework for this. While health is enjoying its moment in the spotlight, we should use the Conference on the Future of Europe to explore what such a vision means in reality.This plenary will put civil society at the centre to collect and explore their perspectives – hopes, concerns, visions – of a new role for the EU in health, what this could look like and how this could lead to a healthier and happier future for all citizens in Europe. Only by pooling our ideas and experience and working collaboratively can we re-fashion our health systems from the ground up, so that together we become fire-proof.",

We must develop sustainable solutions that encourage inter-sectoral alliances and action. Indeed, as with the fight against COVID-19, climate change is a problem that no single actor can solve alone.The pandemic has also highlighted the vital link between environmental and human health, and the urgent need to green our economies in order to meet climate goals. Yet how should profits be balanced against the public good in times of climate emergency? Are the private sector and innovative approaches keys to meeting climate goals?Join us for this interactive session to discuss guiding principles and new models for public-private collaboration in tackling the climate emergency. Be inspired by young professionals and expert voices!",

But what can more European responsibility in global health look like concretely? Which instruments and institutions are needed, and can trust be rebuilt in the wake of lacking solidarity during COVID-19 vaccine distribution?In this fireside chat, EHUI founding member Ilona Kickbusch sits down with Chikwe Ihekweazu, recently appointed Director General of Health Emergency Intelligence at WHO HQ and Head of the new WHO Berlin Hub for Pandemic and Epidemic Intelligence. Join the two as they discuss the role of the Hub in assessing and responding to global health emergencies, draw on Dr Chikwe’s experience in outbreak management, and explore what it will take for Europe to prove herself a true ally to the Global South in the joint fight against global disease threats of the future.",

A necessary enabler for access to this vital instrument of population health is sustainable funding that can be made available in a timely manner.Approaches to routine vaccine funding and the underlying budget-setting process vary greatly across European countries, affecting resilience of the overall vaccine eco-system and its flexibility to integrate new vaccines. The policy debate on how vaccines are funded has intensified due to the pandemic, highlighting the need for a more sustainable funding approach to strengthen immunisation infrastructures, secure uptake of routine vaccinations, and provide timely and equitable access to new vaccines.Join us for this session to review differences in the funding of vaccines across Europe, discuss opportunities to ensure its prioritisation post-pandemic including routine investment into COVID-19 immunisation, and address approaches to support the strengthening of life-course immunisation systems as a critical component of robust pandemic preparedness plans.",

The roles and responsibilities of scientific advisors and politicians in such processes are often ambiguous, and the reasons behind policy decisions are not always communicated transparently to the public - which in turn has a significant impact on people's behaviour.In this session we will: consider the impact of conflicting expert advice on policy makers; learn about the challenges that different professions (researchers, policy makers, communication experts) as well as the general public are confronted with in the process of communicating and interpreting information; explore how increased public availability of data and a high level of public interest can influence interpretation of evidence and subsequently affect behaviour; address the impact that communication strategies can have on public trust in experts, instititutions and decision-making processes. Join us to discuss the complex relationship between information, policy and behaviour, and envision how better data can ultimately lead to better decisions.",

This session will convene experts with experience in promotion and training for hand hygiene, food safety, oral care, cleaning, hygienical design and more – and will address how we can educate better, impact more, and build a stronger and more resilient culture for hygiene in Europe.The session will focus on practical actions, learnings from the pandemic and balancing fear & misconceptions, and will envision a better design of policies, realities, and training efforts for the years to come.",

After decades of frustratingly slow progress, it is time for a rethink to adopt alternative partnership and financing models that incentivise investment in orphan drug development and provide accessible patient care.What new approaches can reward innovation whilst reducing financial risk in rare disease research? How can we move away from a system driven by shareholder interest and deliver orphan drugs as a public good to safeguard supply and access for patients? Why do current PPP models not seem to suffice in the rare disease space, and how can stakeholders better collaborate to share the risk in research and development?This session looks to trigger public institutions, universities, and private companies to build more effective solidarity towards rare disease patients - to support new drug research with better knowledge, assessment and characterisation of treatment whilst ensuring affordable and continued market access. Join us to brainstorm and discuss ideas that question existing business models, explore new approaches to financing rare disease treatment, and to create a flagship for the future.",

This poses great challenges to humanity, but we shouldn´t forget it also offers opportunities: not least “to build forward better”.In this vein the idea of a new social contract (an agreement of everyone with everyone to protect and further the common good) has once again come to the fore. This could lay the foundation for the systemic reforms and responses that we need to build a more resilient future - inclusive, sustainable and solidaric policies that protect both vulnerable populations and ecosystems. Such policies are in the self-interest of everyone and are strategic investments for a healthy future. In a European context, this plenary will explore what such policies could look like and what ideas and innovations can help our phoenix rise again.",

We will look at how people’s circumstances going into the pandemic – their health, job, housing, education – shaped their experience of the crisis, and outline opportunities to better support those who have been most affected.Join us to discuss the policy responses that are needed across governments to create fairer, healthier and more resilient societies, including priority policy options for improving health, tackling inequalities, and ways of working across governments.",
